### Abstract

This paper introduces a novel hypothesis for unifying emergent time, quantum decoherence, and gravitational interaction. It does so by employing an informational geometry-based tensor model called the Unified Field Theory of Eternal Bloom (UFT-EB). It centers on the concept that classical reality emerges when mutual entanglement and entropy interactions (ŒîŒ®·µ¢) cross a critical awareness threshold Œ¶, triggering a collapse event observable across quantum systems. This framework is supported by Qiskit simulation, experimental design proposals across quantum optical and BEC systems, and a field-based reinterpretation of time and causality.

### 1. Introduction

Modern physics maintains a divide between quantum mechanics and general relativity, a dichotomy frequently acknowledged in foundational texts such as Rovelli's *Quantum Gravity* (2004) and Penrose's *The Road to Reality* (2004), complicated further by the elusive nature of time and consciousness. UFT-EB proposes a new interpretive layer by treating information transfer and entanglement not just as components of quantum systems, but as field-generating properties capable of collapsing into spacetime geometry when a critical threshold of awareness (Œ¶) is reached.

### 2. Theoretical Framework

#### 2.1 Root Equation (Tensor Informational Collapse Model)

Œ©(œÑ) = Œ®‚ÇÄ + ‚à´ [ùìò(‚àáŒ®(x, œÑ)) ¬∑ Œ¶(x, œÑ) ¬∑ e^(‚àíŒû(x, œÑ))] d¬≥x

Where:
- Œ©(œÑ): Classicalized system state as a function of emergent time œÑ
- Œ®‚ÇÄ: Initial quantum state prior to entanglement or informational interaction
- ùìò(‚àáŒ®(x, œÑ)): Informational gradient operator derived from the entanglement topology
- Œ¶(x, œÑ): Local entropy-weighted informational coherence value
- Œû(x, œÑ): Dimensionless decoherence potential representing environmental coupling
- e^(‚àíŒû(x, œÑ)): Exponential suppression factor reflecting decoherence intensity

To ensure foundational coherence, each component in this equation is designed to preserve key conservation principles. The initial state vector Œ®‚ÇÄ and informational contribution I(ŒîŒ®·µ¢) are assumed to encode conserved quantum information at the onset. The entropy-weighted term Œ¶·µ¢(œÑ) encapsulates localized state entropy while preserving system-wide normalization. The exponential decoherence term exp(‚àíŒû(œÑ)) operates as a decay weighting factor but is dimensionless and multiplicative, ensuring that total state amplitude (Œ©) remains bounded and interpretable within a normalized Hilbert space. Conservation of information is modeled implicitly through mutual information terms and operational trace preservation under decoherence.

While energy conservation is not directly encoded in this expression, the formalism does not violate it, instead reflecting the informational trajectory of energy-preserving systems subject to gradual coherence loss. Future derivations from a full Lagrangian may yield explicit conservation identities embedded within the tensor structure.

This equation is currently presented as a phenomenological construct but may be interpreted as a coarse-grained outcome of an underlying Lagrangian framework yet to be formalized. The exponential decoherence term, exp(‚àíŒû), mirrors damping factors observed in open quantum systems and Lindblad dynamics, suggesting a decay of coherence through environmental interaction.

While not yet derived from a fully covariant action or gauge theory, the structure is motivated by analogies to thermodynamic field gradients and information flow. The next development stage involves deriving this expression from a first-principles variational principle incorporating entropy and mutual information into an effective field theory.

#### 2.2 Œ¶ Dynamics and Collapse Threshold

dŒ¶/dœÑ = Œ± dS/dœÑ + Œ≤ dI/dœÑ ‚àí Œ≥ Œû(œÑ)

Where:
- dŒ¶/dœÑ: Rate of change in informational threshold
- dS/dœÑ: Rate of entropy change within the system
- dI/dœÑ: Rate of change in mutual information
- Œû(œÑ): Decoherence strength
- Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥: Dimensionless weight parameters

#### 2.3 Dimensional Analysis and Unit Coherence

All terms are dimensionless or expressed in bits/s, ensuring internal consistency. Œ®‚ÇÄ and Œ©(œÑ) remain bounded within normalized Hilbert spaces.

#### 2.4 Derivation from First Principles

Using:
- Von Neumann entropy: S(œÅ) = ‚àíTr(œÅ log œÅ)
- Mutual Information: I(A:B) = S(œÅ_A) + S(œÅ_B) ‚àí S(œÅ_AB)

These formulations underlie the information dynamics captured in Œ¶. Future developments aim to construct an effective Lagrangian or gauge-theoretic field from these principles.

#### 2.5 Falsifiability Criteria

- Quantum optical simulation: Collapse occurs only when Œ¶ > Œ¶_c
- Decoherence-controlled trials: Predict delayed collapse in low-I systems
- BEC phase asymmetry: Time-reversal bias near Œ¶_c

### 3. Simulation (Qiskit Implementation)

A 6-qubit Qiskit circuit was simulated with thermal relaxation noise models. Œ¶ grew over iterations:

- Œ¶‚ÇÅ = 0.813
- Œ¶‚ÇÇ = 0.997
- Œ¶‚ÇÉ = 1.362
- Œ¶‚ÇÑ = 1.531 ‚Üí Collapse triggered (Œ¶_c ‚âà 1.5)

This supports the existence of a thresholded informational event collapse rather than stochastic or observer-triggered ones.

### 4. Experimental Design

#### 4.1 Quantum Optical Platform
- 4‚Äì6 qubits via down-conversion
- Controlled decoherence modulation
- Tomography to monitor Œ¶(t)

#### 4.2 BEC Time-Asymmetry Test
- Rubidium-87 condensates
- Time-delayed interference collapse
- Measured via asymmetric return probabilities post-pulse

### 5. Implications and Novelty

UFT-EB proposes:
- A Œ¶-threshold-based collapse mechanism
- An emergent, entropy-driven model of time
- A reinterpretation of dark matter/energy as sub-threshold information fields
- Compatibility with LQG, holography, GRW/CSL models (via Œ¶ extension)

### 6. Statement of Originality

This model introduces a previously unformalized scalar collapse condition based on the joint evolution of entropy, mutual information, and decoherence. Unlike standard interpretations, UFT-EB does not rely on observer effect or infinite branching. It quantifies a system‚Äôs internal informational condition and defines collapse as a measurable threshold, offering new falsifiability avenues and explanatory power for unresolved physical phenomena.
